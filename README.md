Mile Stone Project 1
<h1 align="center">Fitzmow Landing Page</h1>

This is my first Milestone Project on the Full Stack Web Developer Code Institute course. My aim was to create a fictional landing page that would have the potential for commercial deployment if adapted at a later stage. It is built using HTML, CSS and the Bootstrap 5 framework. The project itself is designed to be front-end only, so back-end functionality does not exist, which includes the form on the contact section. My mentor examined the project at an early stage and deemed that it met the requirements of the brief.

### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

-   #### First Time Visitor Goals

        1. Upon entering the page, users are presented with a clean navigation bar to go to the section of their choice. Underneath there is a Hero Video with Overlaid Text and a "Get Quote" Call to action button.

        3. The user has three options, click the call to action button, scroll down, or use the navigation menu.

    2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to view easily digestible content so that I can get a product overview.

        1. The site has been designed to be fluid, including a scrollspy feature to always indicate in the navigation which section they are currently viewing.
        2. Each section has been designed to show information in a clear and retainable manner, with each information point haveing an associated image.
        3. Customer review information has been presented in a video format, making it easier to absorb than long-winded text.

    3. As a First Time Visitor, I want to look for contact information and explore social media links so that I can evaluate this company's trust within the marketplace.
        1. The contact section is clearly indicated in the navigation, along with a call to action in the hero section that leads to it.
